[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/temd3bf4l84h3lyh/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ssuluh/osrmnet/branch/master)


This project provides necessary .NET wrapper to use OSRM library directly without the web server (https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend).

Our design goal is to follow as close as possible the OSRM project APIs and data type.  User should be able to use the existing OSRM documentation to use this library.

Contribution is always welcome, please email me:  surya@productivityapex.com

# Status
This project is still at pre-release state.  Currently there's only limited implementation for OSRM.Route().

# Getting Started
